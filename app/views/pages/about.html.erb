<h1>About Twittest</h1>
<p>
Having spent much of our lives communicating face-to-face with others in the physical world, most of us are experienced at making judgements about others based on physical appearance, or the way people sound when they speak.  Body language, facial expression, and changing the tone of our voice, can reveal a lot of information in addition to what is actually being said.  This visual information contributes in a big way to our judgements about others.  Perceiving the identity of the person you are speaking with is an essential part of communication, and will influence the way you interact and the kind of information you reveal about yourself.  Online communication can differ considerably because many of the physical signs and gestures that we would normally recognise are absent.  While face-to-face communication presents those involved with visual and auditory information about the person you are speaking with, communication media like email, instant messaging or Twitter limits that information solely to written text.  All we can really know about people on Twitter are in the content of their Tweets, and perhaps the information on their profile.

Furthermore, as is the case with most forms of social media, people using Twitter can choose exactly how they present themselves online.  Twitter users decide for themselves the type of information that they want to include on their profile pages, as well as the kind of images they upload, and they are not usually obliged to prove that any of it is truthful in real life.  Therefore, all of the information we can use to try and identify people on Twitter cannot be relied upon in the same way that visual information might be in a face-to-face conversation.  When we see somebody in real life, we have a pretty good idea what they look like.  However if we see a profile picture on Twitter, there can be no certainty that the account holder resembles their image.  Gaining a sense of other peopleâ€™s identity on Twitter requires a different set of skills to those we are used to.  Clues about personality do exist in online communication, and it is through the written language of Tweets that the identity of Twitter users can be judged.  In exactly the same way that a chatbot user, or indeed someone judging a Turing Test might examine written text, a Twitter user can analyse the content of a Tweet to try and decide what kind of person, or bot, might be writing the message.

Participating in Twittest involves two different aspects of deception.  Firstly, if you are reading Tweets, you will need to decide whether the message is coming from the person that the Twitter profile claims to be.  This means that skill you will have to employ is in spotting a deceptive message.  Research has shown that human beings are not very good at detecting deception (Zhou and Zhang 2008), and we are often very trusting when we receive a coherent response in a conversation.  While body language and facial expressions can reveal that someone is lying, this depends on being able to see the person that you suspect is fibbing.  The only clues you will have in Twitter are in the text.  Studies have shown that increased use of negative language, over-generality, and exaggeration are indicators of lying in written language.  Other research suggests that people lying online tend to use more words that emphasise emotion, whilst also using pronouns like 'she' or 'it' instead of real names (Hancock et al 2008).  However, messages that are shorter in length, such as those found on Twitter, can be harder to judge because there is less content to examine (Zhou and Zhang 2008).

If you are sending Tweets, you may be trying to deceive other people, and this will involve the skill of pretending to be somebody you are not.  Studies suggest that it is more common to distort reality online that with face-to-face communication (Zimbler and Feldman 2011), so you might find this easier than you think!  It can be easier to lie with media that provide a sense of distance, because the deceiver does not have to worry about physical cues that might give them away.  However, Internet technology seems to be particularly attractive to those wishing to be dishonest.  Research suggests that people are more likely to deceive with the use of email compared to writing with pen and paper (Naquin et al., 2010), and this may be to do with people perceiving digital communication as less 'real'.

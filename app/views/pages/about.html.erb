	The 'Turing Test' refers to a proposal made in 1950 by the English mathematician, philosopher and pioneer of computer science, Alan Turing. Turing was interested in whether machines were capable of thinking, and his research is considered one of the foundational studies in the field of artificial intelligence. In order to explore the question of whether machines could think, Turing devised a behaviour test, which he called an â€˜Imitation Game'. This experiment forms the basis for what is now known as the 'Turing Test', and is used to assess the ability of a machine to engage in intelligent conversation with a human being. The Turing Test involves three elements, a human player (or judge), a human conversation partner, and a computer program designed to produce intelligible responses in a normal human conversation. The task of the human player is to decide which of the other two participants is human, and which is a machine. However, the human participant and the computer must remain hidden from the player for the duration of the test. The only way that communication can take place is with text-based conversation, and the player is required to question each partner in turn using a keyboard and screen. Without being able to see who, or what, they are communicating with, the human player must only use the text-based responses to their questions in order to determine whether their conversation partner is human or artificial. If the player cannot tell the difference after the conversations take place the machine is said to pass the test. It is this scenario which has become known as the 'Turing Test'.

	One of the first programs that some consider to have passed the Turing Test was called ELIZA, created by Joseph Weizenbaum. This program worked by analysing the questions posed by the human player, and searching for keywords. If certain keywords were found, ELIZA was programmed to return those words in a predefined sentence, often in the form of another question. While the ELIZA program was very successful at giving people the illusion that they were communicating with another person, it also raised questions about the ability of machines to demonstrate intelligence. Many people argued that ELIZA was only able to simulate human behaviour, and was not actually capable of understanding the language that it was processing. There have been many subsequent debates about whether the Turing Test is a valid measure of intelligence, and one of the most well-known arguments is the known as the 'Chinese Room', developed by John Searle. Searle argues that if a non-Chinese speaker were given suitable instructions to be able to rearrange characters from the Chinese language, they would be able to provide correct and understandable responses to questions in Chinese. However, despite being able to place the characters in the right order, Searle suggests that the person involved would not actually understand what was being said. Searle uses this argument to suggest that a human mind involves 'understanding', while a computer can only be programmed to simulate understanding. The Turing Test has also been questioned on the grounds that it measures intelligence by human standards. It has been argued that a program can pass the Turing Test by demonstrating the unintelligent behaviour of human beings, such as making spelling mistakes. Similarly, if a program demonstrates too much intelligence, such as responding impossibly quickly, it may fail the Turing Test for showing that it can work beyond the limitations of the human mind. In this sense, the Turing Test might be considered to measure the qualities of being human, rather than the degree of intelligence. Arguments have also arisen about the central position of the human player in the Turing Test. It is the human player who must decide whether the conversation is taking place with a real or artificial partner, and this means that the measure of intelligence relies on the attitude and skills of the player rather than through a more objective scientific method.

	Debates such as these have helped ensure that the Turing Test remains fundamentally important in the philosophy of artificial intelligence and the field of natural language processing. The terms 'thinking' and 'intelligence' are very hard to define, and those working in the field have yet to decide on definitions which can be easily implemented in computer programs. The continued interest in the Turing Test is demonstrated by the popularity of the annual Loebner Prize, awarded to the program that most resembles a human being. This competition also offers a grand prize and gold medal for the first computer program that generates responses that are indistinguishable from those of a human, however to this date the prize has never been won.

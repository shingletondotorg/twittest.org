		Chatbots, also called chatterbots, are computer programs designed to simulate a normal human conversation. The term chatbot comes from the words 'chat', meaning to talk, and 'bot', short for robot, essentially meaning an artificial program that can communicate. The goal of these programs is often to appear as human as possible, encouraging a human being into thinking that they are communicating with another real-life person. Chatbot development has been described in three distinct phases: an early stage before the development of the Internet, where chatbots used simple pattern recognition and communicated only with text; a second period where the chatbots became more widely available due to the expansion of the Internet; and a third era in which the technology becomes more commercial, utilising speech synthesis and visual avatars.

		Chatbots have played a major part in the field of artificial intelligence research know as 'natural language processing', and have their origins in the ideas of Alan Turing and the 'Turing Test'. They were pioneered in the in latter half of the 20th century from researchers interested in Alan Turing's ideas concerning the ability of machines to engage in conversation. The two most famous of the these early programs were called 'ELIZA', created in 1966 by MIT professor Joseph Weizenbaum and 'PARRY', created in 1972 by Kenneth Colby. These primitive chatbots were fairly simple and worked using 'pattern recognition', which is a way of recognising the organisation of written language. The chatbot program would analyse the content of the questions posed to find keywords, and use this information alongside a database of predefined phrases in order to generate a response. In 1995 Richard Wallace created the chatbot A.L.I.C.E. (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), which achieved much success and won the Loebner prize three times. A.L.I.C.E. used a special programming language designed for producing chatbots called 'Artificial Intelligence Markup Language'. AILM as it is known, has since become the standard for chatbot programming. Chatbots have also begun to utilise user inputs to augment their predefined database of responses. The chatbot 'Jabberwacky' developed by Rollo Carpenter is one such example, and is said to learn the words and behaviours of its users in real-time. Rollo Carpenter has since launched another chatbot called 'Cleverbot', which achieved much success using this technique. Cleverbot has stored millions of previous conversations in a vast database, allowing the program to reply to questions by choosing a response which has been given previously by a human participant.

		Chatbots have become very popular on the web, being used in many different amateur and commercial enterprises. They can be found on web pages, virtual worlds, online games and social networking sites. Chatbots are often created by enthusiastic amateurs, students, and people interested in artificial intelligence or computer programming. As a result, a number of chatbot communities have emerged, such as 'Pandorabots' where users can develop and publish chatbots online. These chatbots are usually created for entertainment or competition, and are intended to simulate simple, everyday conversations. The aim of such chatbots is to create general responses that can be understood as intelligent, rather than returning specific and detailed information. It is the illusion of being human that is important to these chatbot creators, not necessarily the quality of the information contained in the conversation. Chatbot programming has also been adopted for commercial use on the Internet, and is often utilised by websites or services which send instant messages or email. The content of such conversations is therefore often viewed as more important than the attempt to create a convincing human response. 'Virtual assistants' have now become popular additions to many business websites, and typically involve a life-like avatar which answers questions related to a company's products or services. Perhaps the most well-known example of a virtual assistant is 'Anna' from IKEA's online catalogue. 'Anna' offers users help with information about the furniture for sale on the website, and can communicate in 18 different languages. Virtual assistants can have many advantages over human workers, being able to deal with multiple queries simultaneously, and respond to customers 24 hours a day. Commercial uses such as this offer a way for chatbot technology to become useful to wider society beyond the confines of artificial intelligence competitions or entertainment. Some people have predicted that artificial intelligence programs like chatbots will eventually be used in homes as a way to communicate with domestic computers. Chatbots continue to be popular, demonstrated by the recent release of the original ELIZA program for the iPhone, as well as the A.L.I.C.E. chatbot on popular social networking site Facebook.

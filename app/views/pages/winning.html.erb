		Scoring the Twittest game raises a number of important issues related to the themes of artificial intelligence, chatbots and natural language processing. Allocating a score to an individual in Twittest will take into account both the ability to correctly judge the character of other Tweets, as well as the ability to write convincing messages.

		How would you score the correct identification of Tweets? In order to design a scoring system, you might start by deciding on all the possible outcomes of a Tweet identification. For example, a bot could be correctly identified as a bot. Lets call this 'True A.I.'. A human could be incorrectly identified as a bot, resulting in 'False A.I.'. However, a human could also be correctly identified as human, lets call this 'True Human'. Additionally, a bot might be incorrectly identified as human, which we could call 'False Human'. With these outcomes identified, we might begin to allocate certain values to each outcome. Would 'True A.I.' and 'True Human' incur the same score? Would 'False A.I.' and 'False Human' be equally wrong answers? These are the types of questions you might want to ask if designing a scoring system. There is, however, more to consider in Twittest. Correctly identifying a Tweet may itself involve two levels of judgement. Firstly, you will have to identify whether the Tweet is from a human being or a bot. However, if you decide that the message comes from a human, you will have to make a further judgement as to whether it was written by a teacher or a student. This means that the result 'True Human' will require an additional level, perhaps involving the results: 'True Teacher', 'False Teacher', 'True Student' and 'False Student'. How would you score this level? Would correctly identifying a teacher be worth the same score as correctly identifying a student? Are teacher's Tweets easier or harder to spot?

		Scoring this aspect of Twittest might involve two considerations. Firstly, if you are looking for bots, you would want to know how many out of all the Tweets you thought were bots, were actually bots. This would be a measure of the precision of your Tweet identification. For example, you might say that 5 tweets were from bots, however in reality 3 of those 5 were from bots, and 2 were from humans. Therefore, your precision would be 3 out of 5 (3 correct results, or true positives and 2 unexpected results, or false positives). Secondly however, you might also want to know how many bots you identified correctly out of all the bots in a given game of Twittest. This would be a measure of recall. For example, you might correctly identify that 3 Tweets came from bots, but there were actually 4 Tweets from bots in that particular game of Twittest. Therefore, your recall would be 3 out of 4 (3 correct results, or true positives and 1 missing result, or false negative). This kind of statistical analysis of scoring is known as information retrieval, and is one of the primary measures of accuracy in development of Internet search engines.

		The second aspect of scoring would involve measuring the ability to write a convincing Tweet. This could either be the writing of an honest Tweet, or a deceitful one. Taking into account the principles involved in the Turing Test, could you identify what kind of criteria you would use to score, firstly an honest Tweet, and secondly a Tweet which attempts to mislead? There are a number of possibilities involved in sending a message whilst pretending to be somebody, or something, else. The Tweets in Twittest can be sent from either a student, a teacher, or a bot, and each of these participants may have a unique style of writing that will define their role or character. The skill here will be in successfully writing a message in the persona of the participant being impersonated. However, what would you expect to see in a good impersonation of a teacher? What kind of language would make a believable imitation of a student? How can a message be judged to authentically mimic the conversational abilities of a Twitter bot? While reading and scoring Tweets involves similar methods to information retrieval, the ability to write Tweets which score well in Twittest might be considered comparable to the field of Search Engine Optimisation, or SEO. Search Engine Optimisation is the process of improving the prominence of a website in a search query, and involves similar tactics to improving the ability of your Twittest Tweets to score highly.

	When players of any game get a sense of the scoring system involved, they are able to adjust their involvement in order to gain the highest number of points. If you have worked out how the Twittest might be scored, can you figure out the best strategy to achieve the highest number of points? Are there ways to 'game' the system, that is, to manipulate the scoring system in order to achieve a maximum score? Are you more likely to score higher points by detecting deceptive Tweets or writing them?

		Twitter is a social networking service that allows you to post short text messages to other Twitter users. These short messages are called 'Tweets', and other users who agree to receive your Tweets are called 'followers'. Twitter messages are limited to just 140 characters, prompting many to refer to the service as 'microblogging'. Rather than seeing this character restriction as a hindrance, Twitter users consider it a defining feature of the service, allowing quick information sharing and informal, spontaneous communication. Tweets are essentially public messages, which any Twitter user can receive. However, the Tweets of a particular user can only be read if another user chooses to 'follow' that person. Twitter messages can be sent in different ways. The standard message sent to all of your followers is simply called a 'Tweet'. You can also send a 'Reply' to another Tweet, which means your message will be directed at the original sender, but will still be readable by all of your followers. Another type of message is called a 'ReTweet', and is similar in function to 'forwarding' an email. The ReTweet is a way of copying another Tweet, and sending it to all of your followers, and is one of the primary ways of sharing information in Twitter. Users can also 'Direct Message' another user, and this is a more private type of message that can only be viewed by the sender and receiver. Twitter messaging is not restricted to the Twitter website itself, and many people use third-party software programs, or mobile devices to view and send Tweets. The use of mobile phones to Tweet has become particularly popular as they allow users to send quick, spontaneous messages without having to log into a computer.

		Twitter represents a very different notion of electronic communication compared to email or instant messaging. While answering and replying to emails can be very time consuming and formal, Twitter offers an alternative way of sharing brief, concise and spontaneous messages. Crucially, these messages are not 'synchronous', meaning that Twitter communication does not happen in real time, as a face-to-face conversation might. This is where Twitter offers an alternative to informal communications formats like instant messaging, where users need to be present in a conversation. Technically, Twitter messages are known as 'status updates', similar to those found on the social networking service Facebook. This means that the basic form of 'Tweet' is a way of sending a message to all your followers at once, rather than communicating directly with any one person. This is considered a very important aspect of Twitter, because it reduces the need for a traditional conversation to take place, which many people consider desirable for certain forms of communication. Face-to-face, email, or instant messaging conversations adhere to a form of social etiquette, where participants are expected to take turns in communicating. When a message is sent, the receiver is expected to reply, while the sender anticipates a response. Twitter side-steps these social rules because the standard Tweet is sent to no one person in particular. This means that there is no expectation of a turn-taking conversation. The sender of a Tweet doesn't necessarily expect a reply, while the receiver of the Tweet is not obliged to send a response. This kind of communication is considered by many to be valuable because information can be shared quickly, and informally without having to spend time adhering to social etiquette or turn-taking conversations.

		Twitter has over 300 million users, who send over 300 million Tweets a day (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twitter).	With so much information circulating in the 'Twittershpere' as it has come to be known, people often need a way of searching and filtering content. One of the primary ways of doing this is with the use of 'hashtags': words or phrases prefixed with the '#' sign. Hashtags are a way of adding key words to a tweet, so that others can search for topics of interest. For example, adding the hashtag '#elearning' in a Tweet about the latest technology for learning in schools, would allow others to find your Tweet simply by searching for the term '#elearning'. Use of the hashtag has become a primary way for Twitter users to share topics of interest. Hashtags were not designed by the inventors of Twitter, but have emerged from the way in which people use the service, and their desire to following topics of interest as well as individual users.

		Another important aspect of Twitter is the 'Bot', which is an automated Twitter account operated with software rather than a human being. Twitter bots can be very useful, often supplying you with specialised information when you direct message them; however some can send unwanted messages or spam. Being able to spot a Twitter bot is a valuable skill, and certainly one that will come in useful for Twittest!
